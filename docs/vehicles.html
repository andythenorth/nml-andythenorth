<h2><a name="vehicles-vars">Vehicle variables</a></h2>
Please note that while those variables are available for all vehicles types, some of them only make sense
for one or more vehicle types. For example checking current_railtype for a non-rail vehicle doesn't make
sense at all.

<p>Where for the properties available for all vehicle types XXX can either be TRAINS, ROADVEHS, SHIPS or AIRCRAFT.
Note also that the return values don't yet support units, you'll need to enter the properties untranslated (e.g. road vehicle
weights are in quantities of 0.25 tons). Example:</p>

<p>To determine whether your vehicle can be refitted to a certain cargo, OpenTTD uses the following table:</p>
<table class="t">
<tr><th>Cargo matches refittable_cargo_classes</th><th>Cargo matches non_refittable_cargo_classes</th><th>Cargo in refittable_cargo_types</th><th>Result</th></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>Doesn't matter</td><td>No</td><td>Not refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>Doesn't matter</td><td>Yes</td><td>Refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Not refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Not refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Refittable</td></tr>
</table>
<p>You should use refittable_cargo_classes and non_refittable_cargo_classes to
decide to which cargos your vehicle is refittable, and only use
refittable_cargo_types as a last resort to include/exclude some cargo type.</p>
<p>Note that the default cargo cannot be selected explicitly. Instead it is
automatically set to use the first refittable cargo, whenever one of the
refitting properties is set.</p>

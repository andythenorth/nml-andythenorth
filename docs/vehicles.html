<h2><a name="vehicles-vars">Vehicle variables</a></h2>
Please note that while those variables are available for all vehicles types, some of them only make sense
for one or more vehicle types. For example checking current_railtype for a non-rail vehicle doesn't make
sense at all.

<p>To determine whether your vehicle can be refitted to a certain cargo, OpenTTD uses the following table:</p>
<table class="t">
<tr><th>Cargo matches refittable_cargo_classes</th><th>Cargo matches non_refittable_cargo_classes</th><th>Cargo in refittable_cargo_types</th><th>Result</th></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>Doesn't matter</td><td>No</td><td>Not refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>Doesn't matter</td><td>Yes</td><td>Refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Not refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Not refittable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Refittable</td></tr>
</table>
<p>You should use refittable_cargo_classes and non_refittable_cargo_classes to
decide to which cargos your vehicle is refittable, and only use
refittable_cargo_types as a last resort to include/exclude some cargo type.</p>
<p>Note that the default cargo cannot be selected explicitly. Instead it is
automatically set to use the first refittable cargo, whenever one of the
refitting properties is set.</p>
